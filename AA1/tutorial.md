Follow the given steps to complete this activity:


1. Debug the code


* Open the main.py file.


* Debug why every genome has the same behaviour.

`Note:- there is no condition to check what will happen when the player goes out of bound.`

* Add the break statement in the condition to check if the player goes out of bounds.

    `break`

* Debug why `Neural Network` is not working and throwing an exception.

`Hint:- Make sure number of input matches in the main.py file and in the config-feedforward.txt file`

    `num_inputs = 2`
                     
* Save and run the code to check the output.
